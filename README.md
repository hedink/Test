## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
The Telecommunication industry mostly depends on subscription-based services. The profitability of the Organization mainly depends on its market share or its customer base. The customer acquisition and retention are two important factors that will directly impact the organization’s profitability

Churn rates depict the rate at which customer base shrink over a measured period and are often used to indicate the strength of a company’s customer service division and its overall growth prospects. Lower churn rates suggest a company is in a stronger and competitive state. Customer loss impacts carriers significantly as they often make a significant investment to acquire customers. The ability to identify customers who will abandon services, while there is still time to do something about it, represents a huge additional potential revenue source for every online business. Furthermore, it is always more difficult and expensive to acquire a new customer than it is to retain a current paying customer.

Achieving right balance between customer acquisition and retention is not easy task. Statistics suggests that acquiring new customer is 5 times costlier than retaining the customer. Due to this, many companies are spending hugely to identify those customers who are likely to churn and taking the necessary steps to retain them and reduce the churn rate. Therefore, this project's aim to finding vital factors that increase customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn.

Our team aims to create an efficient and accurate algorithm to identify the most prominent reasons for customer churn. The algorithm considers many factors such as customer's demographic, subscribed services and usage details. The prediction model assists the Telecom company to predict their customers who are more likely stop using their services. The prediction model developed in this work uses machine learning technique.

Building a machine learning model using the past customer churn data and their characteristics & behavior. The customer churn prediction model which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn based on various attributes related to demographics of customer, facilities offered, customer tenure and their charges. This machine learning project embodied in advanced analytics that leverage the existing customer's data to reveal hidden patterns and new insights that will enable the business users to take better decisions.

The supervised tree-based machine learning model will predict the response for existing customers. Upon completion of data analysis and feature engineering using if-else rules, we build tree-based machine learning methods and algorithms for predicting the customer churn. We have analyzed and implemented the Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) tree-based models to build the predictive model. 
Since the COVID-19 global pandemic hit in December 2019, its outbreak has dramatically impacted the world on every level. In Singapore, people have experienced changes in the job market, job postings fell by around 15 percent year-on-year since April 2020, and hiring growth rates have declined since February 2020. Unemployment is expected to spike to 5 percent or more. 
Under this situation, more and more companies post their job positions online, remote-working also becomes mainstream. On the other hand, job scams are on the rise as well. According to an annual Flewjob survey[1], nearly 20% of job seekers have been victim of a job scam (up from 13% in 2016).
In response to this new challenge in the COVID-19 pandemic, our team decided to build an intelligent pattern recognition system to help job seekers to avoid fraudulent job ads. This system can learn patterns from training data – Employment Scam Aegean Dataset from the University of the Aegean(http://emscad.samos.aegean.gr/), and be able to predict potential fraudulent job ads.
We began by dealing with the unbalanced dataset, and utilize ensemble learning to learn patterns from structured data as well as unstructured data (Text) simultaneously. After that, a web-based user interface was implemented then the system becomes useable.
