## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Over the last decade, digital platforms of media emerged as the internet became faster and more accessible to more consumers all over the world. The spread of IT use has spread due to ease of communication throughout the years because it helped connect buyers and sellers together on one system. There are platforms for ridesharing, video streaming/sharing, house rentals, and e-commerce. The video game industry has also been proven to be very profitable because of the consumer buying choices and engagement in the products. In the gaming industry, there are a few key leaders that dominate the mobile and console gaming platforms like Nintendo, Microsoft’s Xbox and Apple. Some of the leaders in mobile and console gaming platforms have tried to get into the PC platform but they have not done it as successfully Valve’s Steam (Staff, 2012). Microsoft and Apple have both created a store for their desktop devices, but they primarily help consumers with productivity.

Those games platforms are definitely with high business value. for example, before there were platforms like Steam for a desktop and laptop game marketplace. People used to have CD games or productivity applications that could be run on a computer. Some people still have those kinds of CDs but as computers have been developed, the CD drive has slowly phased out. For example, before the slow decline of CDs, Valve company created a platform for desktop and laptop computers. They provide users of different operating systems to get access to the games that developers have created for those operating systems. There are other competitors that created their own platforms for digital games too like Blizzard Entertainment, Ubisoft, and EA. A lot of popular game development companies put games into Steam to earn a profit. They do it through the Steam Direct, which is their partnership network. Steam also makes it possible for indie developers to earn a profit from the games they create. The independent developers also go through the same system, Steam Direct. Steam takes 30% of game profits from indie developers and game companies (Colwill, 2018). There isn’t public financial data for Steam’s or Valve’s profits but it is estimated that they have $4.3 billion dollars in profits just from game sales alone in 2017 (“Steam Earned an Estimated $4.3B in 2017, Not Counting In-Apps and DLC — The Esports Observer,” 2018). Many sites claim that Steam is extremely profitable, they control 70% of the PC download market (“Steam controls up to 70% of the PC download market and is,” 2011).

It’s inevitable that there might be more digital game platforms that may pop up in the future that will have innovative ways to draw people in to buy games but there are some different ways to make Steam different from other companies.
As of December 6th, 2018, Epic Games, creator of Fortnite, launched a game marketplace platform that rivals Steam. It is supposed to incentivize indie game makers and publishers to sell their games on Epic Game’s Store because indie game makers and publishers could earn 88% of the profits instead of only 70%, which undercuts the other platforms by 18% (Gilbert, 2018). The outlook of Valve Corporation looks like it would continue to grow as technology is used more widely and if them continue to differentiate themselves with other competitors. As they continue to collect data on their users and use the data, they have collected over the twenty years they have been around; they could contribute a lot to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and virtual reality. Valve could create better games or productivity applications with that kind of information. If they decide to become a public company in the future, it would be a company to invest in.
From this point of view, the future of the gaming platform is still full of unlimited space and business opportunities.
